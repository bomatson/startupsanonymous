      Some "wind down" and others crash, burning the last people
      crazy enough to be on the rocket. We in the tech world, logically,
      focus on the successes and the bets won. Geniuses. Closers. We are
      here for the others (in this current moment, because it is a long
      game after all), the negative space formed by Great Figures.

      <p>
        We are here to lend a non-judgmental ear or mind
        to anyone going through the hard times. We can of
        course lend our experience to help you out, and
        would love to see people climb out of the pit,
        but we are also there for the "I don't even know
        what to ask/say" moments.

      <p>
        Most people will Fall. Sometimes, the Fall is so
        hard that people do not try again. We cannot change
        that, but we can try to make a small dent.
